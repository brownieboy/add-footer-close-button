#Add Footer Close Button

I'm a big fan of the Medium publishing platform, but hate the way that it (and its various offshoots) display a fixed footer bar.   You know, the one that says "never miss an update from [whoever]", and that has a *Get Updates* button on it?    Yeah, guys, I've got that now.  So can I please close the darned thing and get some of my screen real estate back?  It seems not; Medium doesn't give you a way of doing that.

So, I put together this Chrome extension to add a button that hides that footer bar whenever it detects one.  That's all it does.  There's no options.

It currently works on the following Medium-style sites:
* medium.com
* medium.mybridge.co
* hackernoon.com
* blog.expo.io
* medium.freenodecmap.com
* blog.madebywindmill.com
* shift.infinite.red
* hashnode.com

I'll add more offshoot sites as I come across them.  Report via the Chrome Web Store if you want more
