Add Footer Close Button
=======================

I'm a big fan of the Medium publishing platform, but hate the way that it (and its various offshoots) display a fixed footer bar.   You know, the one that says "never miss an update from [whoever]", and that has a *Get Updates* button on it?    Yeah, guys, I've got that now.  So can I please close the darned thing and get some of my screen real estate back?  It seems not; Medium doesn't give you a way of doing that.

So, I put together this Chrome extension to add a button that hides that footer bar whenever it detects one.  That's all it does.  There's no options.

It currently works on medium.com itself, and also hackernoon.com.  I'll add more offshot sites as I come across them.  (It's just a matter of updating a permissions file.)
