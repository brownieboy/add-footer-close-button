ForumTrollBlocker
=================

Block your (un)favourite trolls from forums such as ZDNet, PCPro and CNet. Stomp on those suckers so you never see them again!

Comments on many tech forums often descend into an ill-mannered slanging match.  Insults and ad-hominen attacks abound, with (no doubt overworked) forum admins seemingly unable to halt the abuse.

So, I put together this extension together to block such trolls.

And as one person's "troll" is another person's "heroic fighter for the good cause", you get to define who your particular list of trolls are.  Think of this as an old-style email kill list, but for forums rather than for your inbox.

New TrollPeak Feature!
--------------------
As of version 0.35.  For those weak moments when you can't help yourself!  TrollPeak allows you take a sneaky look at what the troll said, but without having to unblock him.

Forum Troll Stomper currently works with the following forums:

* zdnet.com
* pcpro.co.uk
* cnet.com

I can adapt to work with other forums on request.  Just let me know via the Feedback link.

Developer note: the extension cannot block comments that load inside an iFrame.  That's why I had to remove the ComputerWorld option.

Extension can be installed into Chrome via the Google Chrome Store:
